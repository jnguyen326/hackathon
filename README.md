This project is a Flask-based web application that leverages advanced AI models for image captioning and design feedback generation. Users can upload PDFs, from which the application extracts images and utilizes a pre-trained BLIP model for captioning. These captions are then fed into a Vertex AI language model to generate actionable UI/UX design feedback. The app integrates Google Cloud Storage for file management, provides a user-friendly interface with asynchronous task handling, and is designed with future scalability in mind. It aims to streamline the design critique process by offering automated, intelligent analysis and suggestions for improvement.
